# Sprint velocity = total points of completed stories/total number of sprints
                  = 27/1
                  = 27             

### 2. Retrospective:
1.Instead of using array as database, use MongodB or SQL since an array is erased once browser is closed.
2.Do not have developer stories.
3.The folder hieracrhy of website file needs to be properly organized.
4.Start doing more tests.
5.Make user stories even much smaller so that less time will be spent per story.
