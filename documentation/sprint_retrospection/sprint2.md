# Sprint velocity = total points of completed stories/total number of sprints
                  = 10+5+2+4/2
                  = 12             

### 2. Retrospective:
1. A cannot fully create an account. This user story should take priority.
2.Registered user still not stored in a secure database 

###3.What the team did well
Team members pushed their change to the remote branch to prevent long lived branches which cause big merge conflicts

### 4. What went wrong
Most of the stories were not completed.
As a result, the sprint velocity droped.
No test code was written
Milestones were not set for the second sprint.

### 5. What could be improved
Implementation of more gameplay logic.
Write more tests.
Do things on time.
Have meeetings more often to keep each other updated
