# Sprint velocity = total points of completed stories/total number of sprints
                  = 43/3
                  = 14           

### 2. Retrospective:
We now have a secure database which was a higher priority story from our previous sprints, as some issues depended on the completion of a secure database.

###3.What the team did well
Team members pushed their change to the remote branch to prevent long lived branches which cause big merge conflicts.
Team members were able to finish all of their asigned user stories.
More Javascript /functionality was implemented

### 4. What went wrong
A few of the user stories were supposed to be completed in the second sprint which resulted in a drop in the sprint velocity 
No test code was written

### 5. What could be improved
Implementation of more gameplay logic.
Write more tests.
Do things on time.
